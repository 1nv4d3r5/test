<h1>Click, Link, Compete</h1>
<h3>by Charles L. Chen (clchen@google.com)</h3>
<p>
Click, Link, Compete aims to make multiplayer gaming simple on Android.
</p><p>
To developers, it offers a layer of abstraction over the Bluetooth APIs;
instead of worrying about sockets and input/output streams, developers
can think in terms of sending messages and responding to message received
events.
</p><p>
To players, it offers a gaming lobby that enables players to simply CLICK
on whether they want to host or join a game, LINK their phones, and COMPETE.
</p><p>
Click, Link, Compete is still in early beta; feedback and patches are
VERY welcome!
</p><p>
As with all the other apps on AppsForAndroid, Click, Link, Compete is free and
open source under Apache License 2.0. Feel free to use it in your apps
(whether they are free or not), and if you build something cool with it,
please let me know!
