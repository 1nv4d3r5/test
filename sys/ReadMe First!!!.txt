Jay Nepal...

To check this website... Just simply import the file 'mysql.sql' in PHPMYADMIN... 
and extract the remaing files in the www folder... (Using WAMP/XAMP)
If you're not using PHPMYADMIN then import 'mysql.sql' through MySQL Database server.

If you're still facing difficulties then log on to www.ahmadmushtaq.com for more help.
